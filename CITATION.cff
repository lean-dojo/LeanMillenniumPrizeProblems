abstract: >-
  A formalization of the seven Millennium Prize Problems in the Lean4 theorem prover. 
  This project aims to precisely represent these famous mathematical problems in a
  machine-checkable format, including the Hodge Conjecture, Navier-Stokes Equations,
  P vs NP Problem, Riemann Hypothesis, Yang-Mills Existence and Mass Gap, 
  Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture, and Poincar√© Conjecture.
