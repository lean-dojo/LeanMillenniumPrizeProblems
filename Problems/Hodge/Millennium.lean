# The Hodge Conjecture

This file formalizes the statement of the Hodge Conjecture, which is one of the
seven Millennium Prize Problems posed by the Clay Mathematics Institute.

Again this is my understanding of the problem plus I don't have a background in AG/DG so I tried my best to create helper functions + Used Claude for this problem to understand Cohomology

## What is the Hodge Conjecture?

The Hodge Conjecture provides a link between algebraic geometry and differential geometry.
It states that for a non-singular complex projective variety X, every Hodge class is a rational
linear combination of the cohomology classes of algebraic cycles.

More precisely:
- A Hodge class is a rational cohomology class whose complexification lies in the (p,p)-component
  of the Hodge decomposition of the cohomology.
- An algebraic cycle is a formal linear combination of algebraic subvarieties.
- The conjecture claims that every Hodge class can be represented by an algebraic cycle.

This connection is profound because Hodge classes are defined using analysis and differential
geometry (through the Hodge decomposition), while algebraic cycles are purely algebro-geometric
objects.

Note: We state this as a theorem, not a proposition or axiom, because we want to represent the
mathematical statement that we aim to prove, not assume it as true. In formal verification,
conjectures are stated as theorems with `sorry` as the proof, indicating that the proof
is yet to be completed.

/--
The Hodge Conjecture: for a smooth complex projective variety,
every Hodge class is a rational linear combination of cycle classes.

This is stated as a theorem rather than a proposition because it's a mathematical
conjecture we aim to prove unlike the PvsNP, NS or Riemann Hypothes which is like a yes/no.
