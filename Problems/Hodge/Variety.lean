/- Singular cohomology of a topological space with coefficients in a ring

To me an easy way to understand is the fact that Singular cohomology is a way to measure "holes" and structure in a space.
It assigns algebraic invariants (groups) to a topological space that capture how the space is connected
and what kinds of "cycles" exist in different dimensions.

The (p,q) component of the Hodge decomposition.
For a complex manifold, its complex cohomology decomposes into components H^{p,q},
where p+q equals the cohomological degree.

So how I understood is that The Hodge decomposition splits the cohomology of a complex manifold into
pieces labeled by two numbers (p,q). Think of it like sorting information about the space
into different bins, where each bin tells us something about different geometric features.
It's similar to how we can decompose a signal into different frequency components.

/-- # A structure representing a smooth projective variety over a field

This is an important concept so basically A smooth projective variety is like a "nice" geometric shape defined
by polynomial equations. "Smooth" means it has no sharp corners or cusps (like a sphere rather
than a cone), and "projective" means it lives in a special space where parallel lines meet
at infinity (like how train tracks appear to meet at the horizon).

Singular cohomology with coefficients in a ring R.
This represents the cohomology groups H^n(X,R) of the variety X.

Okay so think of Cohomology groups as algebraic tools that capture the "shape information"
of a space. Different degrees n correspond to different dimensional features - n=1 captures
information about loops, n=2 about voids, etc. The coefficient ring R tells us what kind of
measurements we're using (like using ℚ for rational measurements, or ℂ for complex ones).

Extension of scalars for cohomology.
This operation maps cohomology classes from one coefficient ring to another.
For example, from rational to complex coefficients.

Atleast to me I created this Extension of scalars function cause intuitively think of it is like converting between measurement units.
If you've described a shape using rational numbers (fractions), this operation lets you
convert that description to one using complex numbers, which might reveal additional (again always go into the complex world for more information)
information or make certain patterns clearer.

For a complex variety, the Hodge decomposition of cohomology.
This decomposes the complex cohomology into components H^{p,q} where p+q=n.

To me an easy way to understand is the fact that Hodge decomposition is like splitting white light through a prism
to get different colors. We take all the geometric information about a space (cohomology)
and split it into finer components that reveal more structure. This decomposition is
special to complex manifolds and tells us about how complex-analytic and complex-conjugate
aspects interact.

/--
A Hodge class of weight 2p is a rational cohomology class whose
complexification lies in the (p,p)-component of the Hodge decomposition.

These classes are of special interest because they might be representable by algebraic cycles.

Intutively Hodge classes are special elements in cohomology that have a balanced
nature between complex and anti-complex behaviors. They're defined using rational numbers
but have special properties when viewed in the complex world. The Hodge Conjecture is about
whether these special classes always come from actual geometric objects (algebraic cycles).

/--
An algebraic cycle of codimension p.
This represents formal linear combinations of codimension p algebraic subvarieties of X.
Think of Algebraic cycles as geometric building blocks - they're
combinations of subspaces defined by polynomial equations. For instance, in a 3D space,
a codimension 1 cycle might be a collection of surfaces, while codimension 2 would be
curves. We can add and subtract these pieces to create more complex geometric objects.

/--
The cycle class map sends an algebraic cycle to its cohomology class.
This is a fundamental map relating algebraic geometry to topology.

To me an easy way to understand is the fact that The cycle class map translates between two different languages:
the language of algebraic geometry (using polynomial equations) and the language of
topology (using cohomology). It lets us understand how algebraic objects contribute to
the topological features of our space - like how a curve on a surface creates a specific
kind of "hole" or cycle.

/--
The submodule of cohomology generated by algebraic cycles.
These are cohomology classes that can be represented by algebraic cycles.

To me an easy way to understand is the fact that Algebraic cohomology consists of the topological features that
can be constructed from geometric pieces defined by equations. The Hodge Conjecture asks
whether every cohomology class that "looks like" it should come from algebra (i.e., every
Hodge class) actually does come from algebra. It's like asking whether every shadow that
has the shape of a duck actually comes from a duck-shaped object.
