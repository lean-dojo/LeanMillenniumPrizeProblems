  The 3-dimensional torus T³ = R³/Z³.

  This represents a bounded periodic domain where:
  - Points are identified modulo 1 in each coordinate direction
  - Functions defined on this domain are periodic with period 1

  Using the torus allows us to work in a bounded domain while avoiding
  boundary conditions, providing a simpler setting for studying the
  core mathematical difficulties of the Navier-Stokes equations.

  We will be using the instance defined in `Problems.NavierStokes.Torus` file. Please check the file for more details.

  A function is periodic on the torus if it has period 1 in each coordinate.

  The Millennium Problem statement for Navier-Stokes equations on the torus T³.

  Now one of my friends who works on PDE's told me to also give the equivalent formulation that restricts the problem to a bounded domain (the 3D torus), which eliminates issues related to behavior at infinity while having the same challenges.

  To me intuitively the periodic boundary conditions on the torus simplifies the analysis by removing
  physical boundaries while still allowing for complex fluid behavior such as turbulence.

    Due to the bounded domain, this integral is automatically finite for
    continuous functions, but we include it for consistency with the

  # The energy bound for solutions on the torus.

  One of the key aspects of the bounded domain formulation is that the
  total kinetic energy must remain bounded for all time:

  ∫(T³) |v(x,t)|² dx < E for all t ≥ 0

  This condition is included in the problem statement and is essential
  for physically relevant solutions.

  # The Millennium Problem Statement for the bounded domain case.

  Again the problem is to determine whether exactly one of the following statements is true:

  Either:
  1. Smooth periodic solutions exist for all time, or
  2. There is a finite time beyond which no smooth periodic solution can exist

  This periodic formulation is mathematically equivalent to the original problem (again I haven't proved this yet plus just used the Clay's instutite PDF file on the NS to see the equivalence).
