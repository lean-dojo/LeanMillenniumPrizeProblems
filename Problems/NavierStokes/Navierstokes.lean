  The Navier-Stokes equations in differential form for actually any general n.

    Viscosity coefficient (ν > 0).

    This parameter represents the fluid's resistance to flow or deformation.
    Higher values indicate more viscous fluids (like honey), while lower values
    indicate less viscous fluids (like water). In the Millennium Problem,
    we typically use ν = 1 to normalize the equations.

    It appears in the diffusion term ν·Δu, which models how momentum diffuses
    through the fluid due to molecular interactions.

    External force field acting on the fluid.

    This represents any external forces applied to the fluid, such as:
    - Gravity

    The force field is a function of both space and time, allowing for
    spatially and temporally varying external influences.

    This constraint ensures the model is physically valid. A negative viscosity

    Initial velocity field at time t=0.

    This defines the starting configuration of the fluid flow. In the Millennium
    Problem, this initial condition is assumed to be smooth and have finite energy.

    The evolution of this initial state according to the Navier-Stokes equations
    is the central focus of the Millennium Problem - specifically whether this
    evolution remains smooth for all time or develops singularities.

    Initial velocity is divergence free - the incompressibility condition.

    This mathematical statement expresses that the fluid is incompressible
    (its density remains constant) at the initial time. Specifically:

    ∇·u = ∑(∂uⱼ/∂xⱼ) = 0

    Physically, this means the fluid's volume doesn't change as it flows.
    This constraint must be maintained throughout the flow evolution.

    This is the core dynamical equation of fluid motion:
    ∂u/∂t + (u·∇)u + ∇p = ν·Δu + f

    From left to right, the terms represent:
    - Material acceleration (time derivative following fluid motion)
    - Pressure gradient force
    - Viscous dissipation
    - External forces

    This equation expresses conservation of momentum in the fluid.

    The solution satisfies the incompressibility condition - fluid volume is preserved.

    This constraint requires that ∇·u = 0 everywhere, expressing that the
    fluid density remains constant (fluid is incompressible). Mathematically,

  # A weak solution to the Navier-Stokes equations in a suitable Sobolev space.

  This structure defines a generalized solution concept that requires less regularity
  than classical solutions. Weak solutions are formulated using integration by parts
  and test functions, allowing solutions that may not be differentiable in the classical sense.

  Jean Leray pioneered this approach in 1934, proving the existence of weak solutions
  to the Navier-Stokes equations, but their uniqueness and regularity remain open questions.

    The velocity field belongs to the appropriate Sobolev space.

    Specifically, for each time t, the velocity field:
    - Belongs to L²(ℝⁿ) (finite energy)
    - Has first derivatives in L²(ℝⁿ) (finite enstrophy)

    This corresponds to the Sobolev space H¹(ℝⁿ), which is crucial for
    the energy methods used in analyzing the Navier-Stokes equations.

    These regularity conditions are much weaker than those required for
    classical solutions, allowing for velocity fields that aren't necessarily
    continuously differentiable.

    The solution satisfies the momentum equation in the weak sense.

    Instead of requiring the PDE to hold pointwise, we multiply by smooth
    test functions with compact support and integrate by parts. This transfers
    derivatives from the solution to the test function, requiring less regularity.

    The equation represents:
    ∫∫[-∂φ/∂t·u - (u·∇φ)·u + ν∇u:∇φ - p div φ + f·φ] dx dt = 0

    Each term corresponds to a part of the Navier-Stokes momentum equation:
    1. Time derivative term
    2. Convective (nonlinear) term
    3. Viscous diffusion term
    4. Pressure gradient term
    5. External force term

    This formulation is derived by multiplying the momentum equation by a test
    function φ, integrating over the domain, and applying integration by parts.

    The solution satisfies the incompressibility condition in the weak sense.

    This represents the divergence-free constraint ∇·u = 0 in its weak form.
    It states that for any smooth test function ψ with compact support,
    the integral of u·∇ψ vanishes.

    This is derived by multiplying the incompressibility equation by test functions
    and applying integration by parts:
    ∫ div(u)·ψ dx = 0  →  ∫ u·∇ψ dx = 0

    The condition ensures mass conservation in the weak formulation.

  /--
    The solution matches the initial condition at t=0 in the weak sense.

    Rather than requiring pointwise equality, this states that the velocity field
    at t=0 equals the initial data when tested against smooth functions.

    For any smooth test function φ with compact support:
    ∫ u(0,x)·φ(x) dx = ∫ u₀(x)·φ(x) dx

    This is a weaker way of requiring that the solution starts from the given
    initial condition, suitable for functions with limited regularity.

  Leray-Hopf weak solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations.

  These are a special class of weak solutions with additional properties that make them
  physically meaningful. Named after Jean Leray and Eberhard Hopf, these solutions
  satisfy an energy inequality that represents the physical principle that energy
  should not increase in a viscous fluid without external forcing.

  Leray-Hopf solutions are the most important class of weak solutions because:
  1. They can be proven to exist globally in time (for any initial data with finite energy)
  2. They satisfy physical energy principles
  3. They are the basis for many modern analytical approaches to the Navier-Stokes equations

  The existence of these solutions was one of the first major breakthroughs in the
  mathematical theory of fluid dynamics, demonstrated by Jean Leray in 1934.

    The energy inequality for Leray-Hopf solutions.

    So I like that this inequality expresses a fundamental physical principle: in a viscous fluid,
    the total energy can only decrease over time (in the absence of external forces).

    The inequality states that:

    KE(t) + 2ν∫₀ᵗ Ens(s)ds ≤ KE(0)

    where:
    - KE(t) is the kinetic energy at time t
    - Ens(s) is the enstrophy (squared vorticity) at time s
    - ν is the viscosity coefficient

    Components of the inequality:
    1. Kinetic energy: (1/2)∫|u(t,x)|² dx - represents the total kinetic energy at time t
    2. Viscous dissipation: 2ν∫₀ᵗ∫|∇u(s,x)|² dx ds - represents the cumulative energy
       dissipated by viscous effects up to time t
    3. Initial energy: (1/2)∫|u(0,x)|² dx - the total energy at the initial time

    This inequality is weaker than the energy equality that holds for smooth solutions,
    reflecting the reduced regularity of weak solutions.

    The presence of this inequality distinguishes Leray-Hopf solutions from general weak solutions and provides a selection criterion among the possibly non-unique weak solutions to identify those that are physically meaningful. Again question is do we care about only the physically meaningful solutions?: ) Thats up for debate and what is a good way to find them?
