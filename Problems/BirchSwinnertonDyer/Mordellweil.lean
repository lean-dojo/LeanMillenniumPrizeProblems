# Mordell-Weil Group for Elliptic Curves

This file is my attempt to define certaind definitions of the Mordell-Weil group of rational points on elliptic curves over number fields,
which is central to the Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture.

## Main Definitions

* `EllipticCurve`: Definition of an elliptic curve using a Weierstrass model
* `EllipticCurve.MordellWeilGroup`: The group of rational points on an elliptic curve
* `EllipticCurve.torsion_subgroup`: The subgroup of points with finite order
* `EllipticCurve.rank`: The rank of the Mordell-Weil group

## Mathematical Background

The Mordell-Weil theorem states that for an elliptic curve E over a number field K,
the group E(K) of K-rational points is finitely generated. That is:

E(K) ≅ E(K)_tors ⊕ ℤʳ

where E(K)_tors is the torsion subgroup (points of finite order) and r is the rank.

## My Explanation

An elliptic curve is a smooth curve typically defined by an equation of the form:
y² + a₁xy + a₃y = x³ + a₂x² + a₄x + a₆

Now the Mordell-Weil group consists of all points on this curve with coordinates in a number field K.
These points form a group under a geometric addition law:
- To add two points, draw a line through them, find the third intersection with the curve
- Then reflect that point across the x-axis to get the sum
- The "point at infinity" serves as the identity element

### Some important stuff that we need Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture

1. **Rank**: The number of independent generators of infinite order in E(K)

2. **L-function**: A complex function L(E/K,s) constructed from how the curve behaves modulo primes

3. **BSD Conjecture (informal)**: The rank equals the order of vanishing of L(E/K,s) at s=1

4. **BSD Conjecture (refined)**: The leading coefficient in the Taylor expansion of L(E/K,s) at s=1
   equals a specific combination:

   L^(r)(E/K,1)/r! = (Ω_E · Reg_E · #Sha(E/K) · ∏c_p) / (#E(K)_tors²)

   Where:
   - Ω_E is the real period
   - Reg_E is the regulator (determinant of height pairings)
   - #Sha(E/K) is the order of the Tate-Shafarevich group
   - c_p are local Tamagawa numbers
   - #E(K)_tors is the order of the torsion subgroup

To me atleast now that I gave you some background the BSD conjecture connects the algebraic structure (rank) to analytic behavior (L-function),
providing a potentially powerful computational method for determining the abundance of rational points on elliptic curves.

/-- The Mordell-Weil group of rational points on the elliptic curve.

    This is the group of K-rational points on the elliptic curve E, denoted E(K).
    For an elliptic curve defined by a Weierstrass equation, each point is either:
    1. A pair (x,y) of elements of K satisfying the Weierstrass equation, or
    2. The point at infinity, which serves as the identity element.

    According to Mordell's theorem, this group is finitely generated.
    That is, E(K) ≅ E(K)_tors ⊕ ℤʳ, where E(K)_tors is the torsion
    subgroup (points of finite order) and r is the rank of E.

/-- The torsion subgroup of the Mordell-Weil group.

    This is the subgroup of points P in E(K) that have finite order,
    i.e., points for which there exists some positive integer n such that n•P = 0.

    For elliptic curves over Q, Mazur's theorem states that the torsion subgroup
    is isomorphic to one of:
    - ℤ/nℤ for n ∈ {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,12}
    - ℤ/2ℤ ⊕ ℤ/2mℤ for m ∈ {1,2,3,4}

    For number fields, the torsion subgroup is always finite.

def torsion_subgroup :=
  {P : MordellWeilGroup E // ∃ n : ℕ+, sorry} -- n • P = 0

/-- The order of the torsion subgroup.

    This is the cardinality of the torsion subgroup of E(K), which is always finite
    for elliptic curves over number fields.

    For elliptic curves over Q, Mazur's theorem bounds this order:
    the torsion subgroup has order at most 16, and its structure is one of:
    - ℤ/nℤ for n ∈ {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,12} (orders 1 through 12)
    - ℤ/2ℤ ⊕ ℤ/2mℤ for m ∈ {1,2,3,4} (orders 4, 8, 12, 16)
-/
def torsion_order : ℕ := sorry

/-- The rank of the Mordell-Weil group.

    By the structure theorem for finitely generated abelian groups, the Mordell-Weil
    group E(K) can be decomposed as:

    E(K) ≅ E(K)_tors ⊕ ℤʳ

    where E(K)_tors is the torsion subgroup (points of finite order) and r is the rank.

    The rank represents the number of independent generators of infinite order.
    Mordell's theorem states that E(K) is finitely generated, which implies that r is finite.

    Computing r is generally difficult. The Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture
    relates r to the order of vanishing of the L-function of E at s = 1.
