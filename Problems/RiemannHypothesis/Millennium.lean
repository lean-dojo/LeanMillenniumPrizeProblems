# Riemann Hypothesis Millennium Problem

This file formalizes the Millennium Prize problem on the Riemann Hypothesis. This is the first Millennium problem I had learnt in my undergrad and I was excited to formalize it in Lean.

The Riemann Hypothesis states that all non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function lie on the
critical line, which is the vertical line in the complex plane with real part 1/2.

## Key concepts formalized in this file:

1. RiemannZeta: The Riemann zeta function ζ(s), defined for complex s
2. NontrivialZeros: Zeros of ζ(s) that are not negative even integers
3. CriticalStrip: The region in the complex plane where 0 < Re(s) < 1
4. CriticalLine: The line Re(s) = 1/2 within the critical strip
5. Prime-related functions connected to the zeta function:
   - vonMangoldt function Λ(n)
   - Chebyshev psi function ψ(x)
   - Prime counting function π(x)
6. Li's Criterion: An equivalent formulation of the Riemann Hypothesis using specific coefficients

The Riemann Hypothesis has enormous implications for the distribution of prime numbers. Its truth
would confirm that primes follow the most regular possible distribution allowed by the counting
function constraints.

/-- A complex number is a nontrivial zero of the Riemann zeta function if:
  1. It's a zero of the Riemann zeta function
  2. It's not a negative even integer (which would make it a trivial zero)

  The trivial zeros occur at s = -2, -4, -6, ... and are less interesting for the hypothesis. -/
def IsNontrivialZero (s : ℂ) : Prop :=
  riemannZeta s = 0 ∧ ¬∃ (n : ℕ), s = -2 * (n + 1)

/-- The critical strip is the region of the complex plane where 0 < Re(s) < 1.
    All nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function lie in this strip.

    This is a fundamental region for studying the behavior of the zeta function,
    particularly regarding its zeros. -/
def CriticalStrip : Set ℂ :=
  {s : ℂ | 0 < s.re ∧ s.re < 1}

/-- The critical line is the vertical line in the complex plane with real part 1/2.
    According to the Riemann Hypothesis, all nontrivial zeros lie on this line.

    If true, this would represent a remarkable pattern in the distribution of zeros,
    with profound implications for number theory. -/
def CriticalLine : Set ℂ :=
  {s : ℂ | s.re = 1/2}

/-- The von Mangoldt function Λ(n), which equals log(p) when n = p^k for prime p and positive integer k,
    and equals 0 otherwise. It's closely connected to the Riemann zeta function's logarithmic derivative.

    This function appears in the explicit formula connecting the distribution of primes
    to the zeros of the Riemann zeta function. -/
noncomputable def vonMangoldt (n : ℕ) : ℝ :=
  if h : IsPrimePow n then
    -- When n is a prime power p^k, extract the prime p and compute log(p)
    Real.log (n.minFac)
  else
    0

/-- The Chebyshev psi function ψ(x), which is the sum of the von Mangoldt function
    over natural numbers not exceeding x.

    This function provides a weighted count of prime powers and is asymptotic to x,
    with deviations related to the zeros of the zeta function. -/
noncomputable def psiFunction (x : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  ∑' n : ℕ, if n ≤ ⌊x⌋ then vonMangoldt n else 0

/-- The prime counting function π(x), which counts the number of primes less than or equal to x.

    This is most fundamental function in number theory is central to the study of prime distribution.
    The Riemann Hypothesis provides the tightest possible error bound for its approximation by the logarithmic integral. -/

  if x ≤ 0 then 0 else
    (Finset.filter Nat.Prime (Finset.range (Int.toNat ⌊x⌋ + 1))).card

/-- The Li coefficients, used in the Li criterion

    These coefficients, introduced by Xian-Jin Li, provide an alternative formulation
    of the Riemann Hypothesis in terms of positivity conditions. -/
noncomputable def LiCoefficients (n : ℕ) : ℝ :=
  if n = 0 then 0 else
    Complex.re (∑' m : ℕ, if m ≤ n then
               (-1)^(n-m) * (n.choose m) * (iteratedDeriv m (fun s => (riemannZeta (s+1))⁻¹) 0)
             else 0)

/-- # The Riemann Hypothesis: All nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function have real part equal to 1/2.

    This is the central conjecture that has remained unproven since Riemann's
    original paper in 1859, despite substantial numerical evidence supporting it. -/
def RiemannHypothesis : Prop :=
  ∀ (s : ℂ), IsNontrivialZero s → s.re = 1/2

/-- # A stronger form of the Riemann Hypothesis states that all zeros of the Riemann zeta function in the critical strip are simple zeros (i.e., have multiplicity 1).

    This means that each zero is a single root, not a multiple root, which would
    influence how certain related functions behave near these zeros. -/
def SimpleZerosHypothesis : Prop :=
  ∀ s : ℂ, CriticalStrip s → riemannZeta s = 0 →
    ∃ ε > 0, ∀ z ≠ s, ‖z - s‖ < ε → riemannZeta z ≠ 0

/-- # The Li criterion: an equivalent formulation of the Riemann Hypothesis in terms of the non-negativity of Li coefficients derived from the logarithmic derivative of the zeta function.

    This remarkable equivalence, proved by Li in 1997, states that the Riemann Hypothesis
    is true if and only if all Li coefficients λn are non-negative for n > 0. -/
noncomputable def LiCriterion : Prop :=
  ∀ n : ℕ, n > 0 → LiCoefficients n ≥ 0
